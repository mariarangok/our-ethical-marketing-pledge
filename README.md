# Our Ethical Marketing Pledge
Together, we are making the ethical move for transparent, responsible and honest marketing. This pledge is designed for us to start a conversation about manipulation in marketing, challenge our assumptions about how we sell, and take a stand against unethical practices… together. Thank you for being here. It means the world to us.

# What's next?
**Know that you are not required to be the most ethical today.** Your pledge represents your commitment to learning and growing with us, from within your unique circumstances.

**So first, share your commitment.**

- **Place The Ethical Move badge on your website** (ideally in your footer or your contact page) with a link to theethicalmove.org.

- **Share the words of the pledge on your website** (for example on your about or ethos page). If it is just you, feel free to replace “We” with “I”, etc.

- **Share your pledge with your community** – be it through your email list, on social media, etc. We'll happily share your IG posts if you tag us!

 **And then maybe...**
 
Set up time to go through your touch points and make a plan for how you can make them more inclusive and respectful. Print and hang your pledge poster as a reminder (and to have the words on hand). Maybe put a regular date in your calendar for a review where you can take stock of how far you’ve come and what’s next. These are the things I’m doing, anyway. How you go about this is completely up to you!

Please reach out to us if you’re unsure what any of the language means or what to do next. **This pledge is designed for us to explore what ethical marketing can be, together.**

**Thank you for taking a stand with us and welcome to The Ethical Move!**
